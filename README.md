# SDL2 Chess game


A chess game writing in C++ using SDL2 library. This game was made for my college algorithms subject.
It contains all pieces movement validations and special movements, like the first pawn move or the castle. It also has the king validations, that means you cannot move
your king for a square that a enemy piece control for example.

At the start of the match, the game ramdomly choose one color to play.

I also have added a dumb bot that just pick a valid movement randomly and make it.
